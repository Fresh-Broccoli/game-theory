# game-theory
Multiplayer game about game theory.

This game is based on the skeleton code provided by [Juriy](https://github.com/Juriy/gamedev).

Anyways, the game works by having the host host the game on their computer. Clients can then join the game and learn about game theory by playing the prisoner's dilemma.
